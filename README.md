pandoc-wxpython
===============

This is a very basic GUI front-end to John MacFarlane's pandoc, written in
wxpython. Please feel free to adapt it to your own ends.

Note, that the code is for Python 2.7 and you will need a working copy of pandoc
already installed. Pandoc can be downloaded from [John MacFarlane's
site](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html).

At the moment, this is a very alpha version, which was specifically written to
meet my own local needs. I have indicated in the source-code where I would like
to go next (see TODO).

If you want to chat, please contact me at di gi tal the ology at g mail dotc om.

Good wishes and happy coding

Paul Roberts
